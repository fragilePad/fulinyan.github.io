## Working experience
---
### Collaboration between [IMB](https://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/imb) and [CATIE](https://www.catie.fr/), Talence France -- PhD CIFRE contract
#### Date: March 2023 - March 2026

Solving combinatorial optimization problems that can be expressed completely or
partially as sequential decision processes by hybrid generic heuristic approach
combining machine learning techniques with optimization techniques.

[Poster](/resume/jobs/thesis/Heuristic_approach_with_machine_learning_alongside_for_resource_constrained_shortest_path_problem.pdf)
[Presentation 1](/resume/jobs/thesis/Techintome_Thèse-Hybridation_ML-OR.pdf)

Keywords: sequential decision process, arc flow formulation, hybridation machine learning - combinatorial optimizaiton, ML alongside OR

### [CATIE](https://www.catie.fr/), Talence France -- research intern
#### Date: April 2022 - September 2022

Implement a reinforcement learning based algorithm to find heuristic solutions
for discrete optimization problems that can be expressed as sequential decision
processes.

Keywords: combinatorial optimization, machine learning, reinforcement learning, dynamic programing

### [IRMAR-INSA](https://irmar.univ-rennes.fr/), Rennes France -- research intern
#### Date: May 2021 - August 2021
Implement algorithms in Julia for the kidney exchange program. Use an L-shaped method to solve the two-level stochastic optimization problem whose second-level problem is solved by the column generation method and study the quality of the solution of the stochastic problem.

Keywords: operational research, mixed integer programming, stochastic optimization, Benders cut generation, column generation, Danzig-Wolfe decomposition, Benders decomposition

### [Siradel](https://www.siradel.com/), Saint-Grégoire, France -- intern
#### Date: May 2020 - August 2020

Optimization of the deployment of base stations for which more flexibility is introduced in the cost/coverage trade-o. Introduce and modify algorithms in a mathematics-oriented optimization library (in C ++) developed by Siradel to adapt to multi-objective optimization functionality.

Keywords: Multi-objective optimization, mixed-integer programming
